# plant_growth
This is smart bridge internship project in which we have worked on predicting plant growth based on several factors like water consumption, humidity, temperature, use of fertilizers both chemical and organic based on the data obtained from Kaggle.
We utilised PowerBI to create dashboard highlighting different features and their impact on plant growth.
